			<p id="summary">Amur tigers are commonly referred to as Siberian tigers, a nickmake they received because of the region where they were found. Unfortunately, populations are declining due to habitat loss and poaching, both of the cats and their prey. Today, only about 360 tigers remain in a smaller geographic area near the Amur river, which is why scientists now refer to them as Amur tigers.</p>
